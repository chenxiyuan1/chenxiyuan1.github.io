# Biography

Chenxi (Chelsea) Yuan is an Assistant Professor of the Department of Informatics at Ying Wu College of Computing, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) since Fall 2024. Before that, she was a postdoctoral researcher mentored by Prof. [Rebecca A. Hubbard](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/rhubbar1#) and Prof. [Kristin A. Linn](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/kristin-linn-phd) in the [Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics (DBEI)](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/) at the Perelman School of Medicine, [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). She obtained her PhD in Industrial Engineering at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) in 2022, under the supervision of Prof. [Mohsen Moghaddam](https://www.sail-nu.com/mohsen-moghaddam).

Her work focuses on developing and applying deep learning approaches that facilitate precision medicine and equitably improve health outcomes. Specifically, she develops deep generative models to generate complete medical data, such as magnetic resonance imaging and electronic health records, for under-represented populations. Additionally, she characterizes and assesses algorithmic fairness in machine learning models that predict prevalent public health diseases like Alzheimerâ€™s disease and breast cancer.


 I am seeking highly self-motivated PhD students who are interested in Fairness of AI in health.
