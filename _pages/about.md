# Biography

I am a postdoctoral researcher mentored by Prof. [Rebecca A. Hubbard](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/rebecca-hubbard-phd) and Prof. [Kristin A. Linn](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/kristin-linn-phd) in the [Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics (DBEI)](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/) at the Perelman School of Medicine, [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). I am a member of [Penn Statistics in Imaging and Visualization Endeavor (PennSIVE)](https://www.dbeicoe.med.upenn.edu/pennsive) center. My methodological work focuses on developing and applying deep learning approaches that facilitate precision medicine and equitably improve health outcomes. Specifically, I  developed deep generative models to generate complete medical data, such as magnetic resonance imaging and electronic health records, for under-represented populations. Additionally, I characterize and assess algorithmic fairness in machine learning models that predict prevalent public health diseases like Alzheimerâ€™s disease and breast cancer.

I obtained my PhD in Industrial Engineering at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) in 2022, under the supervision of Prof. [Mohsen Moghaddam](https://www.sail-nu.com/mohsen-moghaddam) and Prof. [Sagar Kamarthi](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/kamarthi-sagar/). My work focused on the development and application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in intelligent manufacturing. 

My research interests include but are not limited to the following:   
* **Generative AI**: Diffusion Models, Generative Adversarial Networks, LLMs, Multimodal Learning
* **Fairness in AI**: Algorithmic Fairness, Fairness Verification, Missing Data, Imbalanced Data
* **Interdisciplinary Application**: Healthcare, Bioinformatics, Intelligent manufacturing
