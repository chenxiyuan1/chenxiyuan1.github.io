I am a postdoctoral researcher at University of Pennsylvania and I work with Dr. Rebecca A. Hubabrd and Dr. Kristin A. Linn. I obtained my PhD in Industrial Engineering at Northeastern University in 2022, under the supervision of Professor [Mohsen Moghaddam](https://www.sail-nu.com/mohsen-moghaddam). My research focuses on the development and application of generative AI models in mission-critical tasks, with a focus on Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) and product development.
