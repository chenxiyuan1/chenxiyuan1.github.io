# Biography

I am a postdoctoral researcher from Department of Biostatistics, Perelman School of Medicine at University of Pennsylvania. I work with Dr. [Rebecca A. Hubabrd](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/rebecca-hubbard-phd) and Dr. [Kristin A. Linn](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/kristin-linn-phd). I am a member of Penn Statistics in Imaging and Visualization Endeavor [(PennSIVE)](https://www.dbeicoe.med.upenn.edu/pennsive) center. My methodological work focuses on developing and applying deep learning approaches that facilitate precision medicine and equitably improve health outcomes. Specifically, I develope deep generative models to generate 3D strucutral Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. ...

I obtained my PhD in Industrial Engineering at Northeastern University in 2022, under the supervision of Prof. [Mohsen Moghaddam](https://www.sail-nu.com/mohsen-moghaddam) and Prof. [Sagar Karmathi](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/kamarthi-sagar/). My work focused on the development and application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in user-centered product development. 

My research interests include but is not limited to:   
* Methodology: Generative AI models; Fairness in AI; Multimodal learning; Transfer learning; Natural Language Processing
* Application: Healthcare, Bioinformatics, Manufacturing (User-Centered Design)
