Research support team is dedicated to delivering specialized research services. This initiative draws its inspiration from my mentor, Dr. Hubbard, an avid enthusiast of felines who features her adorable feline companions on her [website](https://www.med.upenn.edu/ehr-stats/study-team.html).

* Work experience: 8 yrs 
* Last employment: Washington, D.C., Oct. 2022. (His former boss relocated and Duke is too stressful to travel by plane.)
* About him: Duke is a true maestro of the meow! His meows are like bright threads sewn into the way our team works together. He reminds us that effective communication isn't solely about words, but about the intention and emotion behind them.
