Duke is a true maestro of the meow! His meows resonate not just as sounds, but as vibrant threads woven into the fabric of our team's interactions. He reminds us that effective communication isn't solely about words, but about the intention and emotion behind them.

## Sky

Sky is a great example of friendship and teamwork. She has an uncanny ability to follow her fellow cats with eager wonder, which makes every journey a fun adventure. Her funny acts remind us that getting along with others and having fun together are important parts of any group project.

Hayden has learned how to find a good mix between work and play. Her favorite way? A slow walk in front of our computer screens, where her tiny paw prints and gentle gaze reminded us to take a moment for company. Her appearance tells us to take a break from our work, breathe, and enjoy what's around us.
